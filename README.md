===========

Get an inside look at how "Github Pages" operates behind the scenes.

## Background
As I was building out some project pages, I got curious about the backend of the servers that were hosting my sites. Using python, I print out some basic information about the operating system of the machine.

## Usage
Just visit the project site and see what it prints out.
